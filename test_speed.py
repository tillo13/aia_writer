2. An AI news article

Your task: Rewrite the news article to match the writer's style perfectly.

STYLE PROFILE:
{json.dumps(style, indent=2)}

ORIGINAL ARTICLE:
{news}

Instructions:
- Apply ALL patterns from the style profile
- Match their conversational voice markers and recurring phrases
- Use their sentence structures and paragraph rhythm
- Incorporate their authenticity markers
- Follow their opening and closing patterns
- Avoid their anti-patterns
- Keep the same factual content but transform the voice completely

Output ONLY the rewritten article, no explanations."""
